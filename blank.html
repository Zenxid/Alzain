                <p>"Happy birthday! I've got a very special gift for you. It might look like an ordinary old lantern, but this one runs on Electro energy and stays alight for a really long time. For those times when you need a little extra light in your life."</p>

                <p>"Birthdays are never occasions for yourself alone. Those who send you cakes, light candles, applaud, and cheer... They are all truly thankful that you were born into this world. That's why it must be a lively occasion, so that everyone can get their chance to thank you! Well then â€” happy birthday! Are you ready? I'm about to ignite the fireworks!"</p>

                <p>"Umm... Happy birthday! I learned a new dance, and I want to show it to you. Uh, am I nervous? *sigh* You saw right through me. It's because... I wanted to incorporate my feelings into the moves, but then the choreography just got more and more difficult... Anyway, I just wish that your life will always be full of wonder and happiness."</p>
